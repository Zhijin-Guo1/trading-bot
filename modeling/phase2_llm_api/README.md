# Phase 2: LLM API Experiments - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
This phase implements **Large Language Model (LLM) based stock prediction** using textual data from SEC 8-K filings to predict 5-day stock price movements relative to the S&P 500.

## ⚠️ Important Correction Note
Initial experiments had a **data leakage issue** in the few-shot strategy. All scripts have been corrected to properly implement few-shot learning without data contamination.

## Key Corrections Made

### 1. **Fixed Few-Shot Data Leakage**
 Uses separate training examples, test set untouched

### 2. **Balanced Examples**

2 UP, 2 DOWN examples (balanced)

### 3. **Consistent Test Sets**

All strategies use same 100 test samples

## How to Run Corrected Experiments

### 1. Run All Three Models

```bash
# GPT-3.5 (cheap, fast)
echo "1" | python llm_experiment_corrected.py

# GPT-4 (expensive, better)
echo "2" | python llm_experiment_corrected.py

# Gemini (free tier available)
python llm_gemini_corrected.py
```

### 2. Compare Results

```bash
python compare_all_models.py
```

## Corrected Methodology

### Few-Shot Implementation
```python
# Training examples (from separate training set)
training_examples = [
    {"text": "...", "outperformed_market": 1},  # UP example 1
    {"text": "...", "outperformed_market": 1},  # UP example 2
    {"text": "...", "outperformed_market": 0},  # DOWN example 1
    {"text": "...", "outperformed_market": 0},  # DOWN example 2
]

# Test set (100 samples, never used for examples)
test_data = sampled_data_corrected.csv

# All strategies use same test set
zero_shot: evaluate(test_data)
few_shot: evaluate(test_data, training_examples)
chain_of_thought: evaluate(test_data)
```

## Expected Improvements

With corrected methodology:
- **Fair comparison** across all strategies
- **No data leakage** in few-shot
- **Balanced prompts** reduce prediction bias
- **Consistent metrics** (all show 50% actual UP rate)

## Cost Estimates

| Model | Per 100 Predictions | Full Experiment (600) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| GPT-3.5 | $0.03-0.05 | $0.20-0.30 |
| GPT-4 | $0.50-1.00 | $3.00-6.00 |
| Gemini | Free (60/min limit) | Free |

## Scripts Removed (Archived)

The following scripts were moved to `old_versions/` due to data leakage issues:
- llm_8k_experiment.py
- llm_gpt4_experiment.py
- llm_gemini_experiment.py
- evaluate_llm.py
- evaluate_openai.py
- openai_baseline.py
- analyze_results.py

## What We Implemented in Phase 2

### 1. **Multi-Model LLM Evaluation Framework**
Built a comprehensive framework to evaluate multiple LLM providers:
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4-turbo
- **Google**: Gemini Pro
- **Anthropic**: Claude (framework ready, not tested due to API constraints)

### 2. **Three Prompting Strategies**

#### Zero-Shot
- Direct prediction without examples
- Simplest and fastest approach
- Revealed strong prediction biases in models

#### Few-Shot Learning
- Initially flawed implementation (data leakage)
- Corrected to use 2 UP + 2 DOWN balanced examples from training set
- Examples provide context for model decisions

#### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
- Step-by-step reasoning approach
- Asks model to analyze: event type → impact → market reaction → prediction
- Provides interpretable reasoning but showed unexpected DOWN bias

### 3. **Data Processing Pipeline**
- Sampled 200 examples from test datasets (2023-2024 data)
- Created two dataset variants:
  - **Standard**: All price movements (100 samples)
  - **10% Threshold**: Extreme movements only (100 samples)
- Ensured 50/50 class balance for fair evaluation

### 4. **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**
Implemented tracking for:
- **Performance**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- **Behavior**: Prediction bias, confusion matrices
- **Cost**: Per-prediction pricing, total experiment costs
- **Operational**: Response times, token usage

### 5. **Key Findings from Initial Experiments**

#### Performance Results (GPT-3.5)
| Strategy | Standard Dataset | 10% Threshold |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Zero-shot | 49.0% | 50.0% |
| Few-shot | 52.1% | 54.3% |
| Chain-of-thought | 49.0% | 54.0% |

#### Behavioral Patterns
- **Zero-shot**: Heavy UP bias (93% predictions)
- **Few-shot**: Moderate UP bias (86% predictions)
- **Chain-of-thought**: Heavy DOWN bias (12-15% UP predictions)

#### Cost Analysis
- **GPT-3.5**: ~$0.0005 per prediction (very affordable)
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.05 per prediction (100x more expensive)
- **Gemini**: Free tier available (60 requests/minute)

### 6. **Issues Discovered & Fixed**

#### Data Leakage in Few-Shot
- **Problem**: Test samples used as training examples
- **Impact**: Unfair advantage, inconsistent test set sizes
- **Solution**: Separate training examples, consistent test sets

#### Class Imbalance in Examples
- **Problem**: 2 UP, 1 DOWN examples caused bias
- **Solution**: Balanced 2 UP, 2 DOWN examples

### 7. **Tools & Scripts Developed**

#### Core Experiment Scripts
- `llm_experiment_corrected.py`: GPT-3.5/GPT-4 experiments
- `llm_gemini_corrected.py`: Gemini experiments
- `compare_all_models.py`: Cross-model comparison

#### Analysis Capabilities
- Automated performance comparison
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Prediction bias detection
- Confusion matrix visualization

### 8. **Insights & Learnings**

#### Model Limitations
- Current LLMs struggle with financial prediction (near-random performance)
- Strong prediction biases regardless of actual data distribution
- Prompt design significantly affects behavior but not accuracy

#### Prompt Engineering Challenges
- Different prompting strategies produce opposite biases
- More complex prompts (CoT) don't guarantee better performance
- Models lack true understanding of financial cause-effect relationships

#### Cost vs Performance
- GPT-3.5 offers best value (cheap but ~50% accuracy)
- GPT-4 likely better but 100x more expensive
- Gemini provides free alternative with similar performance

### 9. **Experimental Design Best Practices**
- Always separate training and test data
- Ensure balanced examples in few-shot learning
- Track all metrics: performance, cost, and behavior
- Test multiple prompting strategies
- Maintain reproducibility with saved datasets

## Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete corrected experiments** for all three models
2. **Test GPT-4** to see if superior model improves accuracy
3. **Optimize prompts** to reduce prediction bias

### Future Improvements
1. **Fine-tuning**: Train smaller models on our specific data
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models/strategies
3. **Feature Engineering**: Use LLMs to extract features for traditional ML
4. **RAG Approach**: Include similar historical examples for context
5. **Hybrid Models**: LLM for text understanding + ML for prediction

### Production Considerations
- Start with Gemini (free) or GPT-3.5 (cheap) for MVP
- Implement bias correction post-processing
- Consider confidence thresholds for trading decisions
- Monitor for API changes and model updates

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully established an LLM evaluation framework and revealed that current general-purpose LLMs achieve only ~50-54% accuracy on stock prediction from 8-K filings. While this is barely better than random, the framework provides:

1. **Baseline performance** for LLM-based approaches
2. **Cost benchmarks** for different models
3. **Behavioral insights** into model biases
4. **Clean architecture** for future experiments

The corrected implementation ensures fair comparison and provides a solid foundation for exploring more sophisticated approaches like fine-tuning or hybrid models.
