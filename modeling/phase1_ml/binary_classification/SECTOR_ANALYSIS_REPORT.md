## 3. Global vs Sector-Specific Models

### Surprising Result: Global Model Usually Wins

| Approach | Average Accuracy | Sectors Won | Key Insight |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Global Model** | 50.86% | 7/11 | More data beats specialization |
| **Sector Models** | 49.39% | 4/11 | Insufficient data per sector |

**Why Global Models Win:**
- **More training data** (11,784 samples vs 466-1,949 per sector)
- **Cross-sector patterns** exist in corporate language
- **Regularization works better** with larger datasets
- **Sector models overfit** on smaller samples

### Sectors Where Specialization Helps
Only 4 sectors benefit from dedicated models:
1. **Consumer Staples**: +8.79% improvement (52.75% vs 43.96%)
2. **Information Technology**: +3.57% improvement (50.00% vs 46.43%)
3. **Utilities**: +1.51% improvement (46.79% vs 45.28%)
4. **Financials**: +0.93% improvement (49.23% vs 48.30%)

## 4. Most Predictable Sectors

### 💡 **Tradeable Sectors (>2% Edge Over Baseline)**

1. **Real Estate (57.89% accuracy, +7.18% edge)**
   - Most predictable sector
   - Clear language patterns in property/REIT disclosures
   - Sample events: acquisitions, lease agreements, property sales

2. **Materials (56.94% accuracy, +5.56% edge)**
   - Mining, chemicals, construction materials
   - Commodity price impacts clearly stated
   - Production updates have predictable effects

3. **Consumer Discretionary (54.39% accuracy, +2.46% edge)**
   - Retail, automotive, leisure
   - Consumer trends easier to interpret
   - Sales data translates to clear signals

### Why These Sectors Are Predictable

**Real Estate & Materials:**
- **Tangible assets** with clear valuation impacts
- **Straightforward language** (acquired, sold, discovered)
- **Less ambiguity** in operational updates

**Consumer Discretionary:**
- **Direct consumer metrics** (same-store sales, traffic)
- **Immediate market interpretation** of trends
- **Seasonal patterns** are well understood

---

## 5. Least Predictable Sectors

### Information Technology (46.43% vs 55.65% baseline)
- **Complex products** difficult to assess
- **Forward-looking statements** dominate
- **Technical jargon** obscures impact
- High baseline (55.7% UP) hard to beat

### Consumer Staples (43.96% vs 51.65% baseline)
- **Stable businesses** = less volatile language
- **Routine updates** lack signal
- **Small changes** have outsized effects

### Utilities (45.28% vs 51.70% baseline)
- **Regulated environment** = predictable language
- **Rate cases** are complex to interpret
- **Weather impacts** are unpredictable

---

## 6. Trading Strategy Implications

### Recommended Approach: Selective Sector Trading

**Focus on High-Edge Sectors:**
```python
if sector in ['Real Estate', 'Materials', 'Consumer Discretionary']:
    if model_confidence >= 0.55:  # Lower threshold for good sectors
        execute_trade()
```

**Expected Performance:**
- **Coverage**: ~32% of events (these 3 sectors)
- **Accuracy**: 56.4% weighted average
- **Edge**: +4.7% over baseline

### Risk Considerations
- Sector concentration risk
- Cyclical nature of Real Estate and Materials
- Consumer Discretionary sensitivity to economic conditions

## 7. Statistical Analysis

### Sample Size Effects

| Sector | Train Samples | Test Samples | Model Performance |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Industrials** | 1,949 | 389 | Global wins |
| **Consumer Discretionary** | 1,780 | 285 | Global wins |
| **Information Technology** | 1,357 | 336 | Sector helps (+3.57%) |
| **Communication Services** | 197 | 74 | Insufficient data |

**Key Insight**: Sectors with <1,000 training samples generally benefit from global model.

### Class Balance by Sector

Most balanced sectors (closest to 50/50):
- Health Care: 50.7% UP
- Energy: 49.1% UP
- Real Estate: 50.7% UP

Most imbalanced sectors:
- Information Technology: 55.7% UP
- Communication Services: 44.6% UP (actually DOWN-biased)

## 8. Why Sector Analysis Matters

### Discovered Patterns

1. **Sector language differs**: Real Estate uses concrete terms, Tech uses abstract concepts
2. **Market expectations vary**: Tech expected to grow (55.7% UP baseline)
3. **Predictability correlates with tangibility**: Physical assets easier to predict than services
4. **Global patterns exist**: Corporate disclosure language transcends sectors

### Implications for NLP in Finance

- **One-size-fits-all models miss sector nuances**
- **But sector-specific models need sufficient data**
- **Hybrid approach optimal**: Global model with sector features
- **Focus on high-signal sectors** for trading

---

## 9. Recommendations

### For Model Development

1. **Use global model as base** (better regularization)
2. **Add sector as a feature** rather than separate models
3. **Increase weight on predictable sectors** in training
4. **Consider sector-specific confidence thresholds**

### For Trading

1. **Focus on Real Estate, Materials, Consumer Discretionary**
2. **Avoid Information Technology and Utilities**
3. **Use sector-adjusted baselines** for performance evaluation
4. **Monitor sector rotation** for regime changes

### For Further Research

1. **Sub-sector analysis** (e.g., REITs vs commercial real estate)
2. **Cross-sector momentum** effects
3. **Sector-specific event types** (M&A vs earnings)
4. **Time-varying sector predictability**

---

## 10. Conclusion

### The Surprising Truth

**Global models beat sector-specific models** in most cases, contradicting the intuition that specialized models would perform better. This suggests:

1. **Corporate disclosure language is universal** 
2. **Cross-sector patterns provide valuable signal**
3. **Data quantity trumps domain specialization**

### The Opportunity

Three sectors show consistent predictability:
- **Real Estate**: +7.18% edge
- **Materials**: +5.56% edge  
- **Consumer Discretionary**: +2.46% edge

These represent **32% of all 8-K filings** and could form the basis of a sector-focused trading strategy.

### The Bottom Line

While overall directional prediction remains challenging (~51% accuracy), **sector analysis reveals pockets of predictability**. Real Estate and Materials sectors demonstrate that certain industries have more interpretable disclosure patterns, offering a potential edge for selective trading strategies.
