# Volatility Prediction Experiments

## Overview
This folder contains experiments for predicting stock volatility (magnitude of price movements) from 8-K filing text, rather than trying to predict direction (up/down).

## Key Insight
While text features have weak correlation with directional returns (~0.02-0.15), they show stronger correlation with volatility/absolute returns (~0.25-0.35).

## The Two Training Tasks Explained

### Task 1: Volatility Regression (Predict Exact Magnitude)

**Training Process:**
```python
# Step 1: Prepare training data
X_train = TfidfVectorizer.fit_transform(text)  # Convert text to TF-IDF features
y_train = np.abs(adjusted_return_pct)          # Target: absolute returns [2.5, 0.8, 3.1, ...]

# Step 2: Train model to predict volatility magnitude
model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Learn weights: which words → higher volatility

# Step 3: Make predictions on test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)  # Model outputs: [2.3, 0.9, 2.8, ...]

# Step 4: Evaluate correlation between PREDICTIONS and ACTUAL
correlation = pearsonr(y_pred, y_test)  # How well do predictions match reality?
```

**Baseline Performance (if model learns nothing useful):**
- **Random predictions**: Correlation ≈ 0.00 (no relationship)
- **Always predict mean**: Correlation = 0.00, MAE = std(volatility) ≈ 2.5%
- **Our target**: Correlation > 0.25 (moderate relationship)

### Task 2: Binary Classification (High vs Normal Volatility)

**Training Process:**
```python
# Step 1: Create binary labels
threshold = np.percentile(np.abs(returns), 75)  # Top 25% threshold (e.g., 3.5%)
y_train = (np.abs(returns) > threshold)         # Binary: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, ...]
                                                 # 1 = high volatility event
                                                 # 0 = normal volatility

# Step 2: Train classifier
model = LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Learn: which word patterns → high volatility

# Step 3: Predict on test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)           # Binary predictions: [0, 1, 1, 0, ...]
y_prob = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1] # Probabilities: [0.2, 0.8, 0.9, 0.3, ...]

# Step 4: Evaluate
precision = TP / (TP + FP)  # When we predict "high vol", how often are we right?
recall = TP / (TP + FN)     # What % of actual high vol events do we catch?
```

**Baseline Performance (if model learns nothing):**
- **Random guessing (50/50)**: Precision ≈ 25%, Recall ≈ 50%
- **Always predict "normal"**: Precision = N/A, Recall = 0%
- **Always predict "high"**: Precision = 25%, Recall = 100%
- **Our target**: Precision > 35%, Recall > 35%, F1 > 0.35

## What the Models Actually Learn

### Regression Model Learns:
```
"bankruptcy" → +5.2% volatility
"investigation" → +4.8% volatility
"earnings beat" → +1.2% volatility
"regular operations" → +0.5% volatility
```

### Classification Model Learns:
```
Pattern: "SEC" + "investigation" + "material" → P(high volatility) = 0.85
Pattern: "earnings" + "in line" → P(high volatility) = 0.15
```

## Critical Distinction: Correlation Types

### ❌ NOT This (Meaningless):
```python
# Direct correlation between TF-IDF features and volatility
correlation = pearsonr(X_tfidf[0], y_volatility)  # Single feature vs target
# This would be ~0 because TF-IDF is sparse and high-dimensional
```

### ✅ But This (Meaningful):
```python
# Correlation between MODEL PREDICTIONS and actual volatility
model.fit(X_train, y_train)              # Train model first
predictions = model.predict(X_test)       # Get model predictions
correlation = pearsonr(predictions, y_test) # Compare predictions to reality
```

## Expected Results vs Baselines

| Metric | Random Baseline | Mean Baseline | Our Target | Good Result |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **Regression** | | | | |
| Correlation | 0.00 | 0.00 | >0.20 | >0.30 |
| MAE | ~2.5% | ~2.5% | <2.3% | <2.0% |
| R² | 0.00 | 0.00 | >0.04 | >0.09 |
| **Classification** | | | | |
| Precision | 25% | N/A | >35% | >40% |
| Recall | 50% | 0% | >35% | >40% |
| F1 Score | 0.33 | 0.00 | >0.35 | >0.40 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.50 | 0.50 | >0.60 | >0.65 |

## Why These Baselines?

1. **Regression Correlation = 0.00 baseline**
   - If model predictions are random/uninformative, they won't correlate with actual values
   - Even a 0.20 correlation means the model found SOME signal

2. **Classification Precision = 25% baseline**
   - Since 25% of events are "high volatility" by definition (top quartile)
   - Random guessing would be right 25% of the time
   - 40% precision means we're 60% better than random

## Running the Experiments

### Step 1: Run Main Experiment (Local, 5-10 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/engs2742/trading-bot/modeling/phase1_ml/regression
python volatility_prediction_experiment.py
```

Output will show:
```
EXPERIMENT 1: VOLATILITY REGRESSION
  Training Ridge...
  Test Correlation: 0.2834 (p=1.23e-45)  ← Better than 0.00 baseline!
  Test MAE: 2.234%                        ← Better than 2.5% baseline!

EXPERIMENT 2: HIGH VOLATILITY BINARY CLASSIFICATION  
  LogisticRegression:
  Precision: 42.3%   ← Better than 25% baseline!
  Recall: 38.7%      ← Catching 39% of high vol events
  F1 Score: 0.404    ← Better than 0.33 random baseline!
```

### Step 2: Interpret Results
- **Correlation > 0**: Model learned something (higher = better)
- **Precision > 25%**: Better than random guessing
- **F1 > 0.33**: Better than random classifier

### Step 3: GPU Experiments (If Available)
```bash
python volatility_embeddings_gpu.py
```
Expected improvement: +5-10% over TF-IDF

## Next Steps After Running

1. **If correlation < 0.20**: Signal too weak, try:
   - Shorter prediction horizon (1-2 days)
   - Item-specific models
   - Add market context features

2. **If correlation 0.20-0.30**: Promising, optimize:
   - Tune hyperparameters
   - Try embeddings (GPU)
   - Ensemble methods

3. **If correlation > 0.30**: Good signal!
   - Build trading strategy
   - Backtest thoroughly
   - Consider real deployment
