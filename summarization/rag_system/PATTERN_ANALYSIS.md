# Pattern Analysis: RAG System Performance

## Retrieval Score Patterns

### High vs Low Performing Filings
- **Best performing** (May 17, +10.22%): Avg retrieval score 0.542
- **Worst performing** (Feb 22, -5.38%): Avg retrieval score 0.550
- **Observation**: Retrieval scores do NOT correlate with return magnitude

### Query Type Effectiveness
1. **guidance_change**: Most effective for earnings reports
2. **earnings_surprise**: High scores (0.58-0.59) for financial results
3. **management_turmoil**: Effective for executive compensation filings
4. **unexpected_events**: Good for capturing unusual transactions

## Summary Quality Patterns

### Successful UP Predictions
**Filing: May 17, 2019 (+10.22%)**
- Key phrases: "shareholder approvals", "significant voting numbers", "shareholder confidence"
- Pattern: Focus on governance and investor sentiment

**Filing: Feb 14, 2019 (+3.57%)**
- Key phrases: "75,000,000 shares issued", "6.9% ownership", "strategic partnerships"
- Pattern: Major ownership changes and partnerships

### Successful DOWN Predictions
**Filing: Feb 22, 2019 (-5.38%)**
- Key phrases: "salary increases", "bonuses", "$1,241,625"
- Pattern: Executive compensation during uncertain times

**Filing: Jan 29, 2019 (-1.19%)**
- Key phrases: "24% year-over-year decrease", "softness", "excess inventory"
- Pattern: Revenue decline and weak guidance

## Critical Insights

### 1. Event Type Matters More Than Retrieval Score
- Executive compensation → Often negative reaction
- Shareholder approvals → Often positive reaction
- Revenue misses → Consistently negative
- Strategic partnerships → Variable based on terms

### 2. Magnitude Indicators
Strong signals found in summaries:
- "24% decrease" → Large DOWN move
- "75 million shares" → Large UP move
- "shareholder confidence" → UP move
- "softness" / "weakness" → DOWN move

### 3. Missing Context Issues
Summaries lack:
- Prior expectations (beat/miss context)
- Peer comparisons
- Market conditions on filing date
- Historical precedent for similar events

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Event-Specific Templates
Create specialized prompts for:
- Earnings reports (focus on beat/miss)
- Executive compensation (compare to performance)
- M&A/partnerships (evaluate strategic fit)
- Guidance changes (compare to consensus)

### 2. Quantitative Feature Extraction
Extract and normalize:
- Percentage changes
- Dollar amounts relative to market cap
- Vote counts as confidence metrics
- Sequential vs YoY comparisons

### 3. Contextual Enrichment
Add retrieval of:
- Previous quarter's metrics
- Analyst consensus estimates
- Stock price leading up to filing
- Sector performance on filing date

## Success Patterns Summary

**Most Predictive Phrases for UP:**
- "shareholder approved"
- "strategic partnership"
- "exceeded expectations"
- "raised guidance"

**Most Predictive Phrases for DOWN:**
- "decreased revenue"
- "softness"
- "executive compensation increase"
- "lowered guidance"
- "excess inventory"

## Conclusion

The RAG system successfully extracts key information but needs:
1. Better event classification
2. Contextual enrichment
3. Magnitude normalization
4. Expectation baselines

With these improvements, prediction accuracy could likely exceed 60%.
